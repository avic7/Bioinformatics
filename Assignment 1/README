# Exercise 1 Transcription, Translation (10 pts)
The following is a partial DNA coding segment from Homo sapiens CD4 gene that encodes a
membrane glycoprotein of T lymphocytes.

1. Produce the corresponding RNA fragment.
2. Produce the partial primary protein sequence (one letter codes for amino acids) using reading
frame 3. Note: Reading frame 3 means the transcription starts at the 3rd nucleotide base.
(You can manually interpret the sequence, or use online tools you can find to do it.))

Choose any two from the following three exercises (each is 20 points) to
complete.

# Exercise 2 Contemporary Issues Summary (20 pts)
Students are more motivated to learn things that they believe are worth learning. In
this exercise, you will look for connections between course material (“bioinformatics, or
computational/mathematical biology”) and recent events or developments that you find via
online news sites, printed news sources, or broadcast media. You will write an summary
on how bioinformatics apply to these current affairs (in plain English, one page, single-
spaced, font size 11 is good). Your summary should include an overview of the event(s), an
introduction of the bioinformatics tools and how they’ve been applied, and the significance
or new knowledge the bioinformatics have brought.
Tips: you can try to associate these areas with the selection of reflective journal review,
or help with selecting the topic of your project.
Below is a story about the 2011 German outbreak, which will give you some directions to
look for a contemporary issues, but please feel free to connect to any events (not necessarily
to be very recent).
“The 2011 Germany E. coli O104:H4 outbreak is one of the first uses of genome sequencing
to study the dynamics of a food-borne outbreak and provides further evidence that genomic

tools can be used to investigate future outbreaks and provide greater insight into the emer-
gence and spread of infectious diseases. As an example to show here, the bioinformatics
applied is the genome sequencing tools (in your summary, you may need to introduce such
sequencing tool with more information). It represented an early example of epidemiologists
collaborating with computational biologists on four continents to stop an outbreak. They
released bacterial DNA sequencing data from one of a patient, which elicited a burst of anal-
yses carried out by computational biologists on four continents. For more information on
the computational methods and data analysis, you can go to their project page on GitHub:

Submission
Submit your answers in the same PDF file you had for exercise 1.

# Exercise 3 (20 pts)
A FASTA file consists of one line of header, the so-called, “definition line” (which starts
with the > symbol), followed by lines consisting only of sequence data (usually 60 characters
per sequence except perhaps the last one). A multi-FASTA contains information regarding
multiple sequences and it starts with the header line for one sequence followed by the sequence
across multiple lines, followed by the header for the second sequence, followed by the second
sequence, and so on. The assignment folder contains a file multiprotein.fasta containing
four proteins.
You should write a python script which does the following: it should ask the user for
the name of an input FASTA file. Let’s say the filename they enter is called ‘stuff.fasta’.
The script should then read the input file. It should then display to the screen information
regarding each sequence. For each, it should display the header line, the first 10 characters
followed by the the number of amino acids in each protein. This will serve as a useful tool
to summarize the contents of a multi-FASTA file.
Submission
1. Submit the source code of this question as asn1e3.py. Make sure to include your name
and student number as comments in the file. You can use Biopython libraries when
available, or just write your own code completing the task.
2. Submit the documentation as READMEasn1e3.txt. It should include information on
how to run your code, any dependency or libraries needed, etc..
3. Submit the screenshot of you running the code and the output in the PDF file you had
before.
